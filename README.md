# Image Processing in Frequency Domain

This repository contains MATLAB code for various image-processing tasks in the frequency domain. The code includes implementations for displaying Fourier spectra, applying low-pass and high-pass filters, and image restoration using the Wiener filter.

## Assignment Overview

This assignment is structured into four main tasks:

1. **Displaying the Fourier Spectrum**
2. **Low-Pass Filtering in Frequency Domain**
3. **High-Pass Filtering in Frequency Domain**
4. **Image Restoration using Wiener Filter**

Each task includes MATLAB code to achieve specific goals in frequency domain image processing.
